# Lab 7 - Fuzz Testing with Hypothesis

This project hardens the PES University Library Fines example by testing its three input functions with property-based fuzzing, then handling malformed inputs consistently.

## Objective

Fuzz testing feeds a function a wide range of valid, malformed, boundary, and unexpected inputs. It helps expose failures that a short list of hand-written examples can miss. This lab uses [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) to generate and shrink test cases automatically.

## Functions

- `parse_member_id(member_id)` accepts an ID such as `STU-1023` and returns `("STU", 1023)`. It trims outer whitespace, requires one hyphen, an ASCII letter member type, and a non-negative ASCII integer ID.
- `total_fine(days_csv)` accepts a comma-separated list of non-negative integer days. It charges 2 per day for each book kept beyond 14 days.
- `shelf_code(title)` returns the uppercase first letters of the first two whitespace-separated title words.

Invalid input, including an unexpected input type, raises `ValueError` with a specific message. The interactive application catches that error and prints a readable validation message.

## Bugs Identified and Fixes

The original functions assumed their inputs were well formed. Wrong types caused `AttributeError` or `TypeError`; member IDs with extra delimiters failed during unpacking; whitespace was retained in member types; fine CSV parsing accepted empty and negative fields inconsistently and leaked integer conversion errors; and short titles caused `IndexError`.

The fixed functions validate types and formats before processing. They reject missing or extra fields, negative or non-ASCII numeric values, empty CSV entries, and titles with fewer than two words. Numeric parsing handles very long ASCII values without relying on Python's string-to-integer digit limit. All invalid values follow the same documented `ValueError` strategy.

## Installation

Python 3.8 or newer is required.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On macOS or Linux, activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` instead.

## Run the Application

```powershell
python library_fines.py
```

Example inputs are `STU-1023`, `10,20,30`, and `The Hobbit`. The application prints a validation message and continues to the next prompt when an input is invalid.

## Run the Fuzz Tests

```powershell
python -m pytest -v test_library_fines.py
```

The suite checks generated valid values against reference behavior and requires malformed strings and unexpected types to raise `ValueError`. Each Hypothesis property test explores up to 120 examples per run. The strategies include text, integers, `None`, booleans, lists, and combined strategies.

## Final Results

The completed suite contains 9 pytest test cases, including 6 Hypothesis properties. The final run passed all 9 tests. The initial run against the original implementation had 5 failures and 4 passes, exposing the validation bugs described above.

## Deliverables

- `FUZZ_TESTING_REPORT.md` documents the initial findings, strategies, fixes, and final run.
- `Lab_7_Fuzz_Testing_Report_24AM426.pdf` presents the four terminal screenshots in order with explanations.
- `screenshots/` contains the original run, initial failures, fixed run, and final test results.
